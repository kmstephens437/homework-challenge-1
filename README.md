# Home work challenge 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor


## Description

This project was part of a homework challenge that created a scenario of a Marketing agency hiring me to refactor an application's code to meet a certain set of Accesibility standards as well as restructuring the code to follow a more logical, less redundant, structure using semantic html/css.

I wanted to complete this project in an effort to better understand and excersise best practices while writing code and also practice the git flow from building code locally to publishing a page and all steps in between.

## Published page using updated code
